# This code was created in order to create an anagram game that runs off of JQuery and flask. I edited the code in flask_vocab.py in order to use flask.jsonfiy() in order to return results that would be then taken by the html file that consists of some Javascript code that then updates the visual UI side of the anagram game. By using .jsonify and javascript, the game no longer reuqires page refreshes to update the UI display and once the game is one it automatically redirects the player to a success page. I also got rid of the manual submit button for the user to submit their answer.
